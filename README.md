# DataMatrix for Windows written in C# (.NET6)

## Application description:

With this program, or rather library, you can create DataMatrix, in .NET6 C# the idea, that is the inspiration, came from DvorakDwarf and his associated repo is (https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch).

It's not as developed as much as his yet. But let's see how far I get.

## Features:

✔️ You can create a DataMatrix where the content is a string (DataMatrix grows dynamically, but don't know when it stops)<br/>
✔️ You can read your generated DataMatrix. (Currently supports only those from this program)<br/>

# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0.0
- DataMatrix can be generated (content: string)
- DataMatrix can be read (content: string)
